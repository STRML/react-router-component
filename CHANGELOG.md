# CHANGELOG

## 0.40.0 (Feb 19, 2020)
  - Ensure joined routes are slash-separated. Thanks @jsg2021. Ref: #205
  - Various dev updates & rebuilds.
  - Use `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` for React >= 16.3.
    - #215 contains work in progress to move to `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`.

## 0.39.1 (Feb 8, 2018)
  - Rem `@providesModule` from copied `warning.js` which can cause issues with Flow/RN.

## 0.39.0 (Sep 26, 2017)
  - React 16 support.
    - Note: React 16 inverts the call order of `setState(obj, cb)`. Parent components' callbacks
      are now called first, where they previously were last.

## 0.38.0 (Sep 13, 2017)
  - Bugfix: Don't drop querystring from `<CaptureClicks>`.

## 0.37.0 (Apr 29, 2017)
  - Import `create-react-class` and `prop-types` to deal with React 15.5 warnings. Thanks @curquhart

## 0.36.5 (Feb 27, 2017)
  - Fix a few unknown props errors. Thanks @BlakeRxxk. Ref: #178, #181
  - Update dev dependencies.

## 0.36.4 (Jan 23, 2016)
  - Add the ability to decode named segments in routes before they are given as props to handlers. See the
    [url pattern docs](http://strml.viewdocs.io/react-router-component/override-url-pattern).

## 0.36.3 (Dec 5, 2016)
  - Reduce npm tarball size by 80% (excluding docs, examples, etc)

## 0.36.2 (Dec 5, 2016)
  - Remove usage of `React.DOM.*`, which will soon be deprecated in React 16 and has incompatibilities with
    Preact, Inferno, etc.

## 0.36.1 (Nov 12, 2016)
  - Fix `component` propType. Thanks @jsg2021.

## 0.36.0 (Jul 12, 2016)
  - Router: Avoid unnecessary `setPath()` calls when receiving identical props. Fixes #177
  - CaptureClicks: Potentially breaking change:
    - Previously, `<CaptureClicks>` would call `props.gotoURL()` (default: `window.location.href = e.href`) as soon
      as the first router failed to match. This was error-prone as it depended on the registration order of routers.
      Subrouters with limited routes could cause navigation not to occur.
      - This was masked somewhat by the extraenous `setPath()` calls. Navigation would occur, but `onNavigation` would
        not fire.
    - Now, `<CaptureClicks>` calls `props.gotoURL()` only if all routers fail to match.

## 0.35.0 (Jul 1, 2016)
  - Update for React v15.2.0: attempt to pass fewer unknown props to DOM elements.
  - Tighten up some missing `propTypes`.

## 0.34.0
  - Update dependencies.
  - Move to Babel 6.

## 0.33.0
  - Possibly breaking changes to callbacks:
    - `onNavigation` and `onBeforeNavigation` is now called on all routers.
      - This fixes [#95](https://github.com/STRML/react-router-component/issues/95)
    - Arity change in callbacks: now `(path, navigation, match)` from `(path, navigation)`.
      - The trailing `match` parameter was added to better track subrouter matches.
      - `navigation` will no longer contain a `match` attribute, which was a singleton and thus
        could not be unique when using multiple routers.

## 0.32.2
  - Hotfix: Accidental 'const', we're not using Babel

## 0.32.1
  - Reuse empty `_query` objects as not to bust ShouldComponentUpdate.

## 0.32.0
  - React v15 support. React 0.14 support will remain for some time.

## 0.31.4
  - Remove `react/lib/batchedUpdates` require(), which was causing issues with CDN users.

## 0.31.3
  - Fix import of `batchedUpdates` (currently ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates) for use with the CDN
    version of React.

## 0.31.2
  - Remove an errant 'let' that made its way into the build.

## 0.31.1
  - Bugfix for `'#'` ignoring.

## 0.31.0
  - Allow returning `false` from `<CaptureClicks>`'s `onClick` handler to completely cancel an anchor navigation.
  - Ignore `'#'` by default in `<CaptureClicks>`, unless we're in a hash routing environment.

## 0.30.1
  - Also pass (path, navigation) to onNavigation to match onBeforeNavigation.

## 0.30.0
  - Support omitting the router's wrapping component entirely by passing a falsy `component` prop.

## 0.29.2
  - Fix typo in previous commit

## 0.29.1
  - Minor: Prevent `:focus` from sticking on clicked anchors under `<CaptureClicks>`.

## 0.29.0
  - Added optional `childProps` hash to the Router. If this is specified, these props will be passed to all
    handlers, contextual routers, and their children. Props defined on a handler or Route directly have priority.
    This fixes [#104](https://github.com/STRML/react-router-component/issues/104).
  - Possibly Breaking Change/Bugfix:
    * We allow passing an actual element as a handler, not just a component. Previously, props on these
      elements were lost, so that `<Location handler={<div className="foo" />} />` would render `<div></div>`.
      This was unintentional and these inner props are now preserved and have priority over `childProps` or
      properties defined on the Route.

## 0.28.0
  - Fix querystring not being properly passed in `PathnameEnvironment`. Incremented minor in case of potential
    unexpected `_query` attribute.

## 0.27.2
  - Switch Object.assign shims, 'object.assign' uses eval()

## 0.27.1
  - Bugfixes for `urlPatternOptions`, which was not properly being passed to `matchRoutes` in some cases.
  - `urlPatternOptions` now propagates down the contextual router hierarchy.
  - Added additional tests for `urlPatternOptions`.

## 0.27.0
  - Breaking Changes (see also 0.27.0-rc1 changelog):
    * Support for React 0.14.0 only.
    * `url-pattern` `0.10` brought breaking updates. If you are customizing `url-pattern`, there is a new API:
      - `createURLPatternCompiler()` and `setCreateURLPatternCompilerFactory()` have been removed.
      - Instead, pass an object at the prop `urlPatternOptions` on either your router or individual routes.
        Route-level options will be merged with precedence over Router options. Contextual router options
        are not merged between levels.
    * `matchKeys` has been deprecated. `url-pattern` now handles this natively; pass an array as the prop
      `urlPatternOptions` when using a regex.


## 0.27.0-rc1
  - Breaking Changes:
    * Remove React-Async and AsyncRouteRenderingMixin.
      - Async support will be re-added via a plugin.
        See [#129](https://github.com/STRML/react-router-component/issues/129) for tracking on this issue.
  - Support for React 0.14.0-rc1.
  - Dependency cleanup.

## 0.26.0
  - Support querystrings.
    * Querystrings are not matched - they are stripped before matching patterns.
    * Querystrings, if present, are parsed and passed as the `_query` prop.
    * See the [querystring docs](http://strml.viewdocs.io/react-router-component/querystring).

## 0.25.4
  - More ES6 fixes.

## 0.25.3
  - Hotfix: adjust API for url-pattern to fit ES6 modules.

## 0.25.2
  - Allow overriding url-pattern's compiler.

## 0.25.1
  - Remove bad ReactComponent typecheck on Route/Location.

## 0.25.0
  - Better React 0.13 support without typechecking errors.
  - Send (path, navigation, cb) - don't lose `navigation` object.
  - Update dependencies (urllite, url-pattern, etc).
  - Adjust for new `url-pattern` API.
  - Use React.batchedUpdates (now exposed on React object)
  - Documentation fixes.

## 0.24.4
  - Update react-async version.

## 0.24.3
  - Support React 0.13 in peerDependencies.

## 0.24.2
  - Fix LocalStorageEnvironment failure in browsers' private modes. Android, iOS, and Safari all keep LocalStorage
    available, but throw when you use it.

## 0.24.1
  - Infinite loop fix when getting parent router in alternative environment.
  - Set default LocalStorageKeyEnvironment path to the empty string instead of undefined/null.

## 0.24.0
  - External links are no longer navigated to, even if used in a <Link> component. This should not cause
    breakage but if it does please open an issue.
    * Reference: #111

## 0.23.3
  - PathnameEnvironment usable in non-html5 history api browser; falls back on window.location.pathname.
    * See #113. Thanks @spicydonuts

## 0.23.2
  - Fix typo

## 0.23.1
  - Move React & React-async to peerDependencies. Fixes #102

## 0.23.0
  - React 0.12 compatibility.

## 0.22.2
  - Bugfix for regex match keys.

## 0.22.1
  - Allow specifying key names for regex matches.
  - Documentation fixes.

## 0.22.0
  - Fixes for nested contextual routers
    * Fixed `prefix` in routers nested > 1 level deep.
    * Matching on `/` inside a contextual router now works as expected.

## 0.21.2
  - Documentation fixes
  - Cancel `<Link>` navigation on everything but a vanilla left click (no modifiers).

## 0.21.1
  - IE8 compat fixes

## 0.21.0
  - Added regex support in `<Location>`'s path attribute.

## 0.20.3
  - Fixed mismatch in arities when using `navigate()` and `setPath()`.

## 0.20.2
  - Fixed middle-click and ctrl/meta click on <Link> components not opening
    in a new tab.

## 0.20.1

  - Fixed `reactify` devdep in examples.
  - Fixed crash on null/undefined inside `<Locations>`. You may now use
    ternary expressions to remove a `<Location>` based on a condition.

## 0.20.0

  - Updated to React 0.11.
  - Fixed intra-page hash routing (scrolling to anchors).

## 0.19.0

  - Updated `url-pattern`, supports optional patterns.

## 0.18.4

  - IE8 compat fixes

## 0.18.3

  - Made `getParentRouter()` method optional when implementing new routers.

## 0.18.2

  - update react-async dep

## 0.18.1

  - fix IE9 not to use pathnameEnvironment by default (pushState is absent
    there).

## 0.18.0

  - **breaking change** Router now only prefetches async state (via react-async)
    if and only if current handler's type is different from next handler's type.

    This now matches the behaviour of getInitialState which is only called once
    for each component instance.

    If you have your async state dependent on props, you need to initiate async
    state update in `componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)` by using values from
    `nextProps`.

## 0.17.0

  - Add `<CaptureClicks>` component to capture clicks on `<a>`-elements and turn
    them into in-app navigation actions. Thanks to Matthew Dapena-Tretter
    (@matthewwithanm on GitHub).

## 0.16.0

  - RouterMixin now delegates state update to setRoutingState method if it's
    available.

  - AsyncRouteRenderingMixin now provides implementation of setRoutingState
    store pendingState update in router's state.

  - AsyncRouteRenderingMixin now provides hasPendingUpdate() which returns t
    if router has active pendingState. This fixes #23.

  - Handler component is now instantiated during state update.

## 0.15.3

  - RouterMixin doesn't specify onNavigation/onBeforeNavigation in
    getDefaultProps and thus allows to specify them in user code (#22).

## 0.15.2

  - Fix bug with require('./environment') using an invalid case.

## 0.15.1

  - Bump react-async to 0.8.0.

  - Fixes to environments, now they properly unsubscribe event listeners.

## 0.15.0

  - Update react dep to 0.10.0. Fix few warnings in test suite.

## 0.14.0

  - Expose environment and environment implementations.

## 0.13.0

  - Contextual routers are only can be in context of other routers if they share
    the same environment.

  - If contextual routers isn't given an environment (via `hash` or
    `environment` prop) then it is default to an environment from parent's
    router if any.

## 0.12.1

  - Do not set `key` prop on handler, this fixes a bug when the same handler
    component will make DOM to be resetted with innerHTML which is neither nice
    nor performant. Also that didn't work with async components.

## 0.12.0

  - `Link.props.onClick` now can prevent navigation by calling
    `event.preventDefault()`. Thanks to Matthew Dapena-Tretter
    (@matthewwithanm on GitHub).

## 0.11.0

  - Add onNavigation and onBeforeNavigation callbacks. Thanks to Dave Mac
    (@DveMac in GitHub).

## 0.10.2

  - Use envify transform for browserify

## 0.10.1

  - Fix bug with router unregistration.

## 0.10.0

  - Handle Router.navigate(path, {replace: true) and `<Link replace />` by
    replacing the current history record instead creating a new one.

## 0.9.2

  - Fix recalculating router's state on new props

## 0.9.1

  - Fix hash router to normalize path correctly ('' coerces to '/')

## 0.9.0

  - Custom routers can now have access to per-navigation params via
    `this.state.navigation`. For example navigation occurred as a result of
    popstate/hashchange event no has `this.state.navigate.isPopState` set to
    `true`.

## 0.8.0

  - `globalHash` property for `Link` to force it to navigate using
    `hashEnvironment`

## 0.7.0

  - Router component now waits for async components (via react-async) before
    updating itself

  - remove Hash namespace, use `hash` prop instead:

    <Locations hash>...</Locations>

  - RouterMixin now doesn't access this.props.children directly but instead gets
    routes via getRoutes() method

  - rework NavigatableMixin: add getPath(), navigate(path, cb), makeHref(path)
    methods, remove getRouter() method

  - add AsyncRouteRenderingMixin

  - add RouteRenderingMixin

  - Link components now generate valid href when instantiated inside contextual
    routers

  - Link components now accept `global` prop to create a link which is forced to
    operate outside of a local router's context

## 0.6.0

  - factor out RouterMixin for reusability
  - expose environment

## 0.5.1

  - fixes for server side rendering

  - browser test suite refactored to use ReactTestUtils

## 0.5.0

  - Location now passes all props to its handler (except "path" and "handler"
    which are reserved for Location)

## 0.4.0

  - fix server side usage

## 0.3.0

  - update react version to 0.9.0

  - environments are now aggregated (reduced number of event listeners)

  - support for hash routers

  - support for contextual routers

  - Link component for navigation

## 0.2.1

  - support for routers with just a single location

## 0.2.0

  - allow passing handlers via "handler" prop

## 0.1.1

  - fix bug with router re-rendering

## 0.1.0

  - initial release
